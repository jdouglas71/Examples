Jimmy Ray!!!
I was just telling Kyle that we were due a Jimmy sighting. Thank god it's over email and I don't actually have to look at your ugly ass! <GRIN>

We all started the band at the same time. We're in the process of ditching the older guy (Tony) and his songs and playing more of Kyle's stuff. He and Angie are getting divorced so he has *lots* of new songs (the strange thing is they all have the same words ;).

Sorry to hear about Oliver's difficulties. That must be very hard. I'm sure you're doing right by him and he's very happy. Just keep in mind that it took me a long time to learn to play sports too, and I still managed to kick your ass in everything. <GRIN>

I never answer my home phone. My cell is (707) 616-9004.

Howdy, I googled you guys and only found you. Is this the band kyle been in for a while? So you learned how to play the bass fairly quick, you were just starting out last time I saw you.  Nice to see pics of you guys. I tried to call you but no answer machine. I thought I see what is up with you all. I'm not doing anything special just the usual grind. Working at the tribe's resort, no gambling yet, maybe by the end of the decade. We do have 40 machines that pay out $1,500, the highest in the state. whoopdedoo. I'll find out later this month if the old man can pay for college with a Vet Admin thing, $750 a month and everything paid for. Not a bad deal and I don't have to move my family to CA. I'm still with the same women from the last time I saw you. My boy is big 4'7 and 79 lbs. 7yrs old. He was diagnosed with auspurger syndrome, which is a mild form of autism. That still doesn't make life easy. He functions well enough, loves our computer he performs well with it. Most of his problems are social. If you seen any autistic kids he isn't that bad with wild movments or sounds, just hyper like any other kid. But being a sports nut I can't teach him how to play anything without a long,long,long process. When he gets it he will get. It is frustrating. I'm not the most patient guy around. Well hope life is treating you good. OOHH yeah Fantasy baseball do you play? If you care to call 406-883-0512. 
                                                                            LATER BRO, Jimira
